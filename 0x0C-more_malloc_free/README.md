More malloc, free
Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX School. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

Concepts to be learned in this repository:
Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the C programming language: the exit function, and calloc and realloc from the standard library

Description of what each file shows:
a function that allocates memory using malloc
a function that concatenates two strings
a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc
a function that creates an array of integers
a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free
a program that multiply two positive numbers
